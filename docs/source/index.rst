Welcome to EvoGuessAI's documentation!
======================================

| Component for decomposition set (backdoor) searching and hardness estimating of SAT instances. Some Boolean formula is estimated in the following way:

1. the algorithm **chooses** decomposition set of some variables of the Boolean formula;
2. the original formula is **splits** into a number of simpler formulas using chosen decomposition set;
3. the resulting simpler formulas are **solved** and statistics of measures are collected;
4. the estimation value (or hardness, in some cases) is **calculated** using special function.

Now more about each stage.

Choosing
--------

Metaheuristic algorithms, in particular evolutionary ones, are used to choose decomposition sets.
While working algorithm builds new decomposition sets based on previously estimated decomposition sets.
Special functions are used to estimate them.

Splitting
---------

To split original formula into a number of simpler formulas, the values of variables from decomposition set are fixed.
Each fixed value of variable *x* splits the original formula in two: the case of the positive literal of *x* and the case of the negative literal *Â¬x*.
Since the number of simpler formulas exponentially depends on the size of the decomposition sets, the Monte Carlo method is used to generate a random sample of formulas of limited size.

Solving
-------

At this stage, the SAT solver processes the resulting set of simplified formulas.
Depending on the used evaluation function, the solver can operate in two modes: solving or propagating.
And also work with time limit or conflicts/propagations budget.
At the end of the solver's process, measures are collected for all formulas, which will be used to estimate the corresponding decomposition set.

Calculating
-----------

| The measures collected in the previous step are used to calculate the estimation. For this one of the functions can be used:

1. **Guess-and-Determine** (G-a-D)
2. **Inverse Backdoor Sets** (IBS), which proposed in [AAAI2018]_
3. **Probability Backdoors** based on G-a-D, which proposed in [AAAI2022]_
4. **Inverse Polynomial Sets** based on IBS
